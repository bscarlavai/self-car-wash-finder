## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Check if Optimization is Working

```

3. **Check Google URL**: Ensure the original Google URL is still valid

### If Performance Isn't Improving:
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. **Check Image URLs**: Ensure they're being processed through images.weserv.nl
3. **Test Different Browsers**: Check if WebP is being served
